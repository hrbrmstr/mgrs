Title: Convert 'MGRS' ('Military Grid Reference System') Coordinates From/To Other Coordinate Systems
Version: 0.2.0

Description: The 'Military Grid Reference System' ('MGRS') is the geocoordinate
    standard used by 'NATO' militaries for locating points on the earth. The 'MGRS' 
    is derived from the 'Universal Transverse Mercator' ('UTM') grid system and 
    the universal polar stereographic ('UPS') grid system, but uses a different 
    labeling convention. The 'MGRS' is used for the entire earth. Methods are
    provided to onvert 'MGRS' coordinates to and from other coordinate systems.
